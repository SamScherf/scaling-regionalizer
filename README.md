# Scaling Regionalizer
This program will scale up an image and break it into multiple pieces without adding new colors.
This program is still very much in testing and not ready for use yet

### PROJECT NOW ABANDONDED. This project has been replaced by the faster tool [biras](https://github.com/samscherf/biras).

## Usage
Place any images you would like scaled up into the "input" folder then simply run scale.py and
any image inside the input folder will be scaled up by 8 times and placed into the "output" folder
with the same name.

## Dependences
This program requires Python 3.1+ and the Pillow library which can be installed with pip like so:

	pip install --user Pillow
